        <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique used to make background images appear as if they're moving slower than their surrounding foreground elements when scrolling through a web page. In this case, the illusion is accomplished by defining a set of 3D perspective and layer transformation CSS rules that will be output in a 2D format on the screen.
